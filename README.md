# LCM
      The lowest common multiple (LCM) of two whole numbers
is the smallest whole number which is a multiple of both.

To find LCM we use formula 

LCM(a,b)=a*b/HCF(a*b)

HCF is The highest common factor (HCF) of two whole numbers
is the largest whole number which is a factor of both.

To find HCF we use Euclid's Algorithm.
